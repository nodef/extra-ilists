**ILists** is a *pair* of *key iterable list* and *value iterable list*, with *unique keys*.<br>

As mentioned above, **ILists** is a data structure that consists of a *pair of*
*iterable lists*, one for *keys* and one for *values*. The keys are **unique**,
meaning there are no duplicate entries. **ILists** is an iterable version of
[Lists]. Use it when you don't have the keys and values as [Arrays].

This package includes functions that allow you to query *about*, *generate*,
*compare*, and *manipulate* the data within the **ILists**. You can find out its
*size*, *add* and *remove* entries, obtain its *properties*, get *parts* or
*subsets* of the data, *find* specific entries within it, perform *functional*
operations, *combine* **ILists** or its sub-entries, or perform *set operations*
upon it. Except `fromEntries()`, all functions take **ILists** as their first
parameter.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. To use it on the web,
simply use the `extra_ilists` global variable after loading with a `<script>` tag
from the [jsDelivr CDN].
